# Game Hound

Game Hound is a web application that provides an easy way to search for games and organize them in collections.

It's built with Symfony 4.1 and utilizes the [IgdbApiBundle](https://github.com/EmanuilNikolov/IgdbApiBundle) - a tool I built to simplify communicating with the [IGDB API](https://api.igdb.com/), which provides up-to-date game information.
